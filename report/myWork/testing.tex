\section{Evaluating usefulness}\label{jiveEval}
In order to evaluate both the usefulness of JIVE, and the changes that were implemented, testing was performed with a group of students.
During this test, the students received a demonstration of what JIVE is, before getting to use it on an implementation of the first and last exercise of the MMI-course.
The criteria to evaluate were both concrete elements, as for instance performance with different filters, and more abstract aspects, e.g. how easy the diagrams are to understand, and how good of an overview they provide.
