Methods:\\

Visualization:\\
	Generating graphs and diagrams representing the program\\
	Easier to get an overview of program structure and execution\\
	generation based on code itself, or trace of program execution, former easiest to use for class diagrams, latter for sequence diagrams and other types of runtime representation.\\

Interactive forwards- and backwards-stepping\\
	two forms: re-execution, state-saving\\
	re-execution: small memory footprint,  slow backward stepping\\
	state-save: fast stepping both ways, needs more memory, amount depending on program. Slower in general due to overhead of saving every change of program-state, but can be fast enough to not be noticed. Will again depend on the program.\\

Queries:\\
	fast way to check object-relations and -properties\\
	Ask the debugger to evaluate a statement concerning the state of the debugged program. E.g. checking constraints or invariants, making sure relations are correct, why did something happen, etc.\\

Tools:\\

GNU debugger (GDB)\\
	tracing, reverse debugging, general debug-stuff\\
	multiplatform, multi-language\\
	remote debugging\\
	CLI-only, needs separate front-end\\

Jinsight\\
	made by IBM\\
	two components: profiler and visualizer\\
	only for z/OS or Linux on system z\\
	builds a trace when application is running\\
	client connects to profiler and visualizes the trace\\
	modified JVM?\\
	120 minute trace limit\\
	very powerful\\

Javavis\\
	relies on the Java Debug Interface (JDI), and the Vivaldi Kernel (a visualization library)\\
	shows dynamic behavior of running program\\
	object diagrams+sequence diagram, UML\\
	smooth transitions\\
	not a debugger\\
	
code canvas (visual studio)\\
	unites all project-files on a infinite zoomable surface\\
	both content and info\\
	layers of visualization - files/folders, diagrams, tests, editors, traces ++\\
	several layers visible at the same time\\
	search\\

trace viewer plugin (g-Eclipse)\\
	g-eclipse=grid, archived project\\
	visualize and analyze communication of message-passing programs - communication graphs\\
	standalone/platform independent\\
	designed for massive parallelism - MPI and similar\\
	debugging\\
	events are marked by different colored nodes in the graphs.\\

Whyline\\
	Interrogative debugger\\
	why did, why did not\\
	works on recorded executions\\

TOD: Trace-Oriented Debugger\\
	omniscient debugger\\
	queries\\
	dynamic visualizations - high-level, graph of event density\\

Jive\\
	combines all fields\\
	contour diagram - Enhanced object diagram, showing objects and their environments: fields, values, relations, inheritance, etc.\\
	sequence diagram - generated during execution, supports zooming and folding to cope with, and hide irrelevant information, but can still become quite large.\\
	stepping - state-saving enables fast backward stepping, and the current state is reflected in the diagrams.\\
	queries - enabled by state-saving. Allows filtering of irrelevant information.\\
	can be used for debugging\\
