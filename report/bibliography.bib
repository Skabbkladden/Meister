@article{Gestwicki2005,
abstract = {A novel approach to the runtime visualization and analysis of object-oriented programs is presented and illustrated through a prototype system called JIVE: Java Interactive Visualization Environment. The main contributions of JIVE are: multiple concurrent representations of program state and execution history; support for forward and reverse execution; and graphical queries over program execution. This model facilitates program understanding and interactive debugging. Our visualization of runtime states clarifies the important point that objects are environments of execution. The history of object interaction is displayed via sequence diagrams, and in this way we help close the loop between design-time and run-time representations. Interactive execution is made possible by maintaining a runtime history database, which may be queried for information on variable behavior, method executions, and object interactions. We illustrate the capabilities of this system through examples. JIVE is implemented using the Java Platform Debugger Architecture and supports the Java language and libraries, including multithreaded and GUI applications.},
