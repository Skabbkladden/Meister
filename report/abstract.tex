Some new students find it hard to understand the concepts of object oriented programming.
This is especially true with the model view controller architecture, as the internal connections can become quite complex.
In order to assist new students with their comprehension, this report investigates multiple available tools, focusing on those suitable to the teaching environment for the HCI course at NTNU.
After a comparison of the available tools, JIVE was chosen for a detailed study.
Through the use of a modified design science approach, several areas with a potential for improvement were found and elaborated upon, and some of these were selected for further improvement.
An evaluation of the changes showed promising results, but further work is desirable for proper determination of its potential, and to resolve remaining issues in the areas of performance and usability.
