New students may find programming in general, and object oriented programming specifically, difficult.
Can be hard to understand concepts, and get a mental model of what is going on.
Especially code generated by GUI-builder tools.
Traditional debuggers are not necessarily helping when detecting a runtime error.
Tools that present the state of a program in a simple visual way may help to understand.
