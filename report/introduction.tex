New students may find programming in general, and object oriented programming specifically, difficult.
Can be hard to understand concepts, and get a mental model of what is going on.
Especially code generated by GUI-builder tools.
Traditional debuggers are not necessarily helping when detecting a runtime error.
Tools that present the state of a program in a simple visual way may help to understand.

Learning goals for MMI-course (man-machine-interaction):\\
Introduce the student to concepts, methods and techniques for designing man-machine-interfaces, knowledge and skills in object oriented construction of graphical window-based interfaces.

Will such tools be useful in helping students to reach the learning goals of MMI and other beginner-courses?
Are existing tools good enough?
If not, can something be modified to better fit the purpose?
