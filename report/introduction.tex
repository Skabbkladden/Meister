New students may find programming in general, and object oriented programming in particular, difficult.
The understanding of computers, and how they work, is not given a lot of focus in the school system, and only a few students have actually tried learning programming before coming to the university.
With little or no previous knowledge, it can be hard to understand the concepts, and to get a mental model of what is going on when writing a program.
Especially code not written by themselves, for example exercise frameworks, and code generated by various tools, can be hard to get a good understanding of.
Traditional debuggers are not necessarily helping when detecting a runtime error, and often significant amounts of time is spent searching for the cause of a bug, instead of actually fixing it \cite{ko2006}.
Tools that present the state of a program in a simple, visual way may help to understand how a program works, and how its components interact with each other.

During the second year of the computer science, and  the informatics studies at NTNU, there is an increased focus on projects and more complex software.
Among the mandatory courses of these studies, we find the course Man-machine-interaction (MMI).
This course handles topics related to creating graphical interfaces, and specifically how to implement a Model-View-Controller-architecture in the Java Swing framework.
The learning goals for the MMI-course are as follows:\\
Introduce the student to concepts, methods and techniques for designing man-machine-interfaces, knowledge and skills in object oriented construction of graphical window-based interfaces.

Will such tools be useful in helping students to reach the learning goals of MMI and other beginner-courses?
Are existing tools good enough?
If not, can something be modified to better fit the purpose?
